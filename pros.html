            <h3>Technology and Functionality</h3>
            <p>
                Liquid 3 functions through a bioreactor filled with microalgae, a plant-like organism that is highly efficient at photosynthesis. Microalgae absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and release oxygen (O2), similar to a tree but at potentially higher rates. The installation is powered by solar energy, ensuring that the system remains eco-friendly and sustainable.

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                Liquid 3 offers significant environmental benefits, particularly for urban areas struggling with high levels of air pollution. The microalgae bioreactor helps reduce the concentration of CO2, contributing to the fight against climate change. By converting CO2 into oxygen, it actively improves the quality of air, making urban environments healthier for residents.

            <h3>Urban Integration</h3>
            <p>
                One of Liquid 3â€™s key advantages is its adaptability to urban landscapes where traditional trees may not survive due to space constraints, poor soil quality, or harsh environmental conditions. Liquid 3 can be installed in various public places such as parks, bus stops, plazas, and sidewalks, integrating seamlessly into the cityscape. Its compact design allows for flexible placement.

            <h3> Educational and Awareness Role</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond its functional benefits, Liquid 3 serves as an educational tool to raise public awareness about innovative solutions for climate change and sustainability. The transparent design enables passersby to observe the process of photosynthesis in action, sparking curiosity and discussions about ecological advancements.
