                Liquid 3 operates as a photobioreactor that leverages microalgae’s natural photosynthesis abilities to absorb CO2 and produce oxygen. Contained within a 600-liter tank, these microalgae interact with carbon dioxide in the environment, binding it and releasing pure oxygen. This process mimics and surpasses the capabilities of conventional plants; while trees and grass perform photosynthesis.

                    The reactor’s design ensures continuous functionality throughout the year, including winter, a time when many trees are dormant and less efficient at carbon absorption. The algae, through their photosynthetic process, utilize light to transform CO2 into biomass and oxygen. This system makes Liquid 3 particularly effective for cities that face challenges related to limited space and high pollution.

                    One of the standout features of Liquid 3 is its ability to be installed with minimal local disruption. Unlike tree planting, which may require preparation of space and can cause infrastructure complications, this bioreactor can be set up quickly and relocated as needed. This modular capability ensures that Liquid 3 can be adapted to various urban environments, fitting into tight spaces and integrating seamlessly with existing cityscapes ￼ ￼.

                    Moreover, Liquid 3 contributes multifunctionality beyond air purification. Some units come equipped with solar panels that generate power for charging USB devices, adding value as eco-friendly urban furniture. Additionally, the structure may include lighting to illuminate public areas at night, enhancing the livability of streets while promoting environmental awareness ￼.                </p>
